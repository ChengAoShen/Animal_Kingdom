# Codebase for Animal Kingdom competition

The code repository is primarily used to participate in the ICME(2024) Multi-Modal Video Reasoning and Analyzing Competition (#Track 6 Animal Action Recognition) in the Animal Kingdom dataset. Based on the MMAction2 framework, we use this data set to train the Video Swin Transformer model and achieve high accuracy in the task of animal behavior recognition.
